            <p>
              My path in technology began with a fascination for mathematics and its applications in solving real-world problems. 
              This analytical mindset naturally led me to explore cybersecurity, where mathematical concepts play a crucial role 
              in encryption, risk assessment, and threat modeling.
            </p>
            <p>
              As I delved deeper into the digital security landscape, I discovered the importance of secure web development practices. 
              This realization sparked my journey into front-end development, where I now combine my security awareness with 
              creative problem-solving to build applications that are both functional and secure.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, I'm committed to becoming a cybersecurity professional while continuing to develop my web development skills, 
              believing that the intersection of these fields is where the most impactful digital solutions are created.
